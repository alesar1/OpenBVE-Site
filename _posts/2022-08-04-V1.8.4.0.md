### Significant Changes:
* New: Change to using a scratch-written bitmap decoder. This improves the 256-color and reduced color transparency hacks considerably (Primarily BVE1 / BVE2 era content)
* New: Add **DistanceLastStation** animated variable.
* Fix: Only data from the player's train should be sent to input device plugins.
* Fix: A stale matrix could be sent to the shader in GL3 mode (could cause floating objects at the camera position in rare cases)
* Fix: The **Timetable** element on XML panels was not correctly hidden.
* Change: Improve the station stop point selection algorithm. Please see <https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Errata#station-stop-selection> for further details.
* Hacks: When hacks are enabled, but the first specified background is missing, map to generic texture.
* Hacks: Improve empty first argument hack.
* Hacks: Update routefile patch database.
